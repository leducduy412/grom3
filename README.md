# Re-implementation the Bayesian inference for Dirichlet Gro-M3 model

## Abstract
This is a Notebook implementation version of Bayesian inference to estimate the variable grouping structure and model parameters for Dirichlet Gro-M3s. The paper information: Yuqi Gu, Elena E. Erosheva, Gongjun Xu, & David B. Dunson (2023). Dimension-Grouped Mixed Membership Models for Multivariate Categorical Data. Journal of Machine Learning Research, 24(88), 1â€“49.

## The experiment of the paper
To evaluate the practical effectiveness of Gro-M3, the authors applied it to two real-world dataset: the NLTCS funtional disability survey and the IPIP personality test. The results show that  the Dirichlet Gro-M3 posterior sampler is both computationally efficient and empirically accurate at learning variable groupings and latentprofile parameters on real multivariate categorical data.
